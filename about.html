            <p style="color: white">A game is a fun activity with rules that can be mental or physical, and is played for entertainment.<br> Games can be played with different types of equipment, such as controllers, playing cards, or the body. The goal of a game can vary, and some games have simple rules, while others have complicated rules.<br> Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship.
